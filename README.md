# Spritoglobin
Spritoglobin is a sprite viewer for North American and European versions of Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story.

In order to install the required libraries, run this command on the project's root folder: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

In order to run the program, you can either use the included `run.bat` file on Windows, or run the following command on the root folder: `python3 -m spritoglobin`

This program is still in development, and likely to be deprecated before it's feature-complete.
I'm mostly just uploading this version because it's still got a lot of use on its own, even though it's missing so many editor features and saving isn't implemented quite yet.
All of Spritoglobin's testing was done on the North American version of the ROM, so issues may arise while viewing the European version.
